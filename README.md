## Billing & Licensing

- Merchants are prompted to choose a plan on first use (paywall).
- Billing is handled via Shopify's Billing API ($5 one-time).
- After payment, the app receives a callback and updates the Subscription status in the database.
- The embed script checks `/api/license` on every page load and aborts if the license is not active.
- Admin UI and storefront features are blocked if the subscription is not ACTIVE.
- Webhooks keep the subscription status in sync with Shopify.
- Cron job checks for expiring subscriptions and sends notification emails via SendGrid.
